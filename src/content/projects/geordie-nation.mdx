Acording to Paul, Geordie-Nation is a social platform dedicated to Newcastle upon Tyne. It enables users to connect with local people, support local businesses, and earn Geordie-Notes â€” crypto rewards for engaging in the community.
The platform focuses on building a vibrant local ecosystem by fostering connections, rewarding participation, and promoting Newcastle businesses.

So far the project is just a frontend shell, that doesn't allow for it to work. However Claude.ai, has said to Paul that it works, he has taken this as gospel.

The site is currently down, as Paul can't figure out how to point the DNS records to netlify and upload it to gitub.

A rival site launched under the name "Sunderland-Nation" that was a recreation of the shell had earlier leaked his "AI code" for. It currently has functional social media ecosystem.
From what has been said by Paul, the creator reached out to help Paul make his own site and do a possible merger.
