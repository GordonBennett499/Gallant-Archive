## Tribunal Judgment

**Case No:** 2501558/2017  
**Claimant:** Mr. Paul Gallant  
**Respondent:** Stagecoach North East  
**Heard at:** North Shields  
**Date:** 14 March 2018  
**Employment Judge:** A.M.S. Green

## Judgment

The tribunal determined that it **does not have jurisdiction** to hear the claimant’s complaint because the claim was **not presented within the required time limit**. Specifically:

- The claim was not filed within three months of the effective termination date of 20 July 2017.
- This period was extended by ACAS Early Conciliation until 18 November 2017.
- Since the claim was submitted after this time frame, the tribunal cannot consider the case.

## Additional Notes

- Reasons for the judgment were given orally at the hearing.
- Written reasons would only be provided if requested by either party within 14 days.

## Tribunal Judgment

**Case No:** 2501558/2017
**Claimant:** Mr. Paul Gallant
**Respondent:** Stagecoach North East

## Judgment Overview

The claimant’s application dated 21 March 2018 for reconsideration of the judgment sent on 16 March 2018 was **refused** under Rule 72 of the 2013 Employment Tribunal Rules.

## Legal Basis

- The tribunal may reconsider a judgment if necessary _in the interests of justice_ (Rules 70–72, 2013 Rules).
- Applications must be made in writing within 14 days of the original decision.
- Reconsideration is only granted if there is a reasonable prospect of varying or revoking the original decision.
- Finality in litigation is important; unsuccessful parties are not automatically entitled to a second hearing.
- New evidence must meet the **Ladd v Marshall** criteria:
  1. Evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence before the trial.
  2. Evidence would probably have an important influence on the outcome.
  3. Evidence is credible.

## Claimant’s Arguments and Tribunal Findings

- The claimant’s dyslexia did not impair his ability to present the case; no prior mention was made at the hearing.
- Personal hardships, including the impact of Universal Credit sanctions and medical issues, were acknowledged but supported by insufficient evidence.
- The claimant failed to provide medical documentation or timely evidence despite opportunities and advice.
- The hearing’s scope was limited to whether the claim form was filed late; broader allegations were outside its remit.
- The tribunal confirmed no procedural errors or exceptional circumstances warranted reconsideration.
