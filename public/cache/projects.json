TV sets, and Funding. To help finance this endeavor, Paul has said he is \"designing an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as a two-fold solution\".\n\n## Features\n---\n\n### 32K TV Sets\nThese new TV sets will come equipped with a unique button that allows viewers to switch between normal and holographic images. Glasses will not be required to view the holographic images.\nThe screens will start at 65 inches and go up to 100 inches or more.","data":{"title":"32k TV","description":"The next generation of Ultra-Ultra-Ultra High Definition TV, with a Crypto twist.","content":"","logo":"","announceddate":"","releasedate":"","links":[{"label":"32k TV Website,","url":"https://32k-tv-inc.com/"}],"projecttype":"Televisions / Crypto-Token","employees":"0","location":"Newcastle"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"slug":"dual-energy","content":"\nThis is the Dual Energy page.","data":{"title":"Dual Energy","description":"Buy some land, fill it with wind and solar generators... profit?","logo":"","announceddate":"10/05/2024","releasedate":"","links":[{"label":"Facebook,","url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61559598838823"}],"projecttype":"Energy Company / Crypto-Token","employees":"0","location":"Newcastle"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"slug":"geordie-nation","content":"\nAcording to Paul, Geordie-Nation is a social platform dedicated to Newcastle upon Tyne. It enables users to connect with local people, support local businesses, and earn Geordie-Notes — crypto rewards for engaging in the community.\nThe platform focuses on building a vibrant local ecosystem by fostering connections, rewarding participation, and promoting Newcastle businesses.\n\nSo far the project is just a frontend shell, that doesn't allow for it to work. However Claude.ai, has said to Paul that it works, he has taken this as gospel.\n\nThe site is currently down, as Paul can't figure out how to point the DNS records to netlify and upload it to gitub.\n\nA rival site launched under the name \"Sunderland-Nation\" that was a recreation of the shell had earlier leaked his \"AI code\" for. It currently has functional social media ecosystem.\nFrom what has been said by Paul, the creator reached out to help Paul make his own site and do a possible merger.\n","data":{"title":"Geordie Nation","description":"A platform for businesses in Newcastle to connect.","logo":"/img/geordie-nation-logo.png","announceddate":"","releasedate":"30/06/2025","links":[],"projecttype":"Social Network","employees":"0","location":"Newcastle"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"slug":"seeking-you","content":"## Overview\nThe goal for **Seeking You** is vague. It is apparently a social network to rival FaceBook and TikTok, but it is also a cryptocurrency platform, and a content creator platform.\n\nThe website itself has a strapline that reads:\n> AI-powered social media automation for UK content creators. Automatically distribute your content across all platforms and earn SYC tokens for consistent creation.\n\nThis seems to imply that it is infact simply a tool for content creators to distribute their content across multiple platforms.\n\n---\n\n## First version\nPaul has said that the app is, \"Built for content creators by content creators. Stream unlimited, earn cryptocurrency, and connect with a global community in the safest environment on the web.\"\n\nThere was briefly a live site at [seeking-you.org](https://seeking-you.org) but it was never functional. Paul has claimed that the app would be back by the end of **June 2025**.\nThe version of the app that was live was built using an AI tool which generated some basic boilerplate frontend code, but no backend functionality.\n\nA new version was then created on Lovable which you can see [here](https://seeking-you-connect-verse.lovable.app/), again this is more boiler plate code, with no functionality. It appears to have less functionality than the inital **Seeking You**.\n\n---\n\n## Seeking You 2\nAfter the initial launch and subsequent pull of Seeking You, there was a community effort to throw up a quick clone of the app. This became [Seeking You 2](https://www.Seeking-you2.org/). This was built by a single developer in a single day, and included working authentication - simply to spite Paul and show that it was possible to create a functional version of the app in a very short amount of time.\n\n---\n\n## Current version\nPaul has now started another version of **Seeking You** - again using Lovable. This time it does actually seem to have some functionality as the authentication does work. You are able to access a public feed, currently only by manually navigating to the URL [/home](https://seeking-you-help.lovable.app/home). You will need to be logged in to actually see any posts.\n\nAuthentication and user creation _does_ work. However, there are some specific steps you need to take in order to get it to work as the error reporting will always say that the email is already registered. Checking the network tab of the dev tools reveals the actual response from the server which will tell you the _actual_ reason why registration may have failed.\n1. The email must not have been used before, but there is no verification so use any email address, real or fake.\n2. The username must not exist already.\n3. The password _must_ be at least 20 characters, and contain the usual mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters in order to be deemed \"secure\".\n\n_**Be warned:** you cannot delete your account on Seeking You, so if you do create an account _please_ use fake credentials as who knows what Paul might do with them._\n\nIt's worth noting that the header of the app actually reads \"Seeking You Coin\" - which shows what the actual focus of the app is. It is not a social media platform, but rather one of many meme coins that Paul has been trying to get off the ground.\n\n---\n\n","data":{"title":"Seeking You","description":"Meet people, but not in a <em>dating</em> kind of way.","logo":"","announceddate":"","releasedate":"30/06/2025","links":[{"label":"Loveable.ai Version 2 (current),","url":"https://seeking-you-help.lovable.app/"},{"label":"SeekingYou.org (original version, now defunct),","url":"https://www.Seeking-you.org/"},{"label":"Lovable.ai Version,","url":"https://seeking-you-connect-verse.lovable.app/"},{"label":"Seeking You 2","url":"https://www.Seeking-you2.org/"}],"projecttype":"Social Network","employees":"0"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"slug":"streets-of-home","content":"\nThis is the Streets of Home page.","data":{"title":"Streets of Home","description":"A buggy racing game through the streets of Newcastle-upon-tyne.","logo":"","announceddate":"","releasedate":"31/12/2025","links":[{"label":"Github Repo","url":"https://github.com/Paulgallant/Street-s-of-Home-game"},{"label":"Second Github Repo","url":"https://github.com/Paulgallant/sb1-b72wsr3j"}],"projecttype":"Video game with crypto elements","employees":"0","location":"Newcastle"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"slug":"ubbc","content":"\nThis is the United Boat Builders Cup page.","data":{"title":"United Boat Builders Cup","description":"I think this is another racing game.. but boats this time?","logo":"","announceddate":"","releasedate":"","links":[],"projecttype":"Video Game","employees":"0","location":"Newcastle"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}]
