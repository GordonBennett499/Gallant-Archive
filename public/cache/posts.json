Green\n\n## Judgment\n\nThe tribunal determined that it **does not have jurisdiction** to hear the claimant’s complaint because the claim was **not presented within the required time limit**. Specifically:\n\n- The claim was not filed within three months of the effective termination date of 20 July 2017.\n- This period was extended by ACAS Early Conciliation until 18 November 2017.\n- Since the claim was submitted after this time frame, the tribunal cannot consider the case.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- Reasons for the judgment were given orally at the hearing.\n- Written reasons would only be provided if requested by either party within 14 days.\n\n---\n\n## Tribunal Judgment\n\n**Case No:** 2501558/2017\n**Claimant:** Mr. Paul Gallant\n**Respondent:** Stagecoach North East\n\n## Judgment Overview\n\nThe claimant’s application dated 21 March 2018 for reconsideration of the judgment sent on 16 March 2018 was **refused** under Rule 72 of the 2013 Employment Tribunal Rules.\n\n## Legal Basis\n\n- The tribunal may reconsider a judgment if necessary _in the interests of justice_ (Rules 70–72, 2013 Rules).\n- Applications must be made in writing within 14 days of the original decision.\n- Reconsideration is only granted if there is a reasonable prospect of varying or revoking the original decision.\n- Finality in litigation is important; unsuccessful parties are not automatically entitled to a second hearing.\n- New evidence must meet the **Ladd v Marshall** criteria:\n  1. Evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence before the trial.\n  2. Evidence would probably have an important influence on the outcome.\n  3. Evidence is credible.\n\n## Claimant’s Arguments and Tribunal Findings\n\n- The claimant’s dyslexia did not impair his ability to present the case; no prior mention was made at the hearing.\n- Personal hardships, including the impact of Universal Credit sanctions and medical issues, were acknowledged but supported by insufficient evidence.\n- The claimant failed to provide medical documentation or timely evidence despite opportunities and advice.\n- The hearing’s scope was limited to whether the claim form was filed late; broader allegations were outside its remit.\n- The tribunal confirmed no procedural errors or exceptional circumstances warranted reconsideration.\n\n---\n\n**Date:** 6 April 2018\n","data":{"title":"Gallant v.
